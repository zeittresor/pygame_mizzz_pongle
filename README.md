![mizzz_pongle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efb796b5-0bf7-4ebc-850e-cb0a28b8a965)


This is my first game written in python using the pygame repository..

Goal of the Game is to shot each visible pylone using the single ball you descide
in wich direction it should fall, but be aware the wind direction and its speed is
changing all the time (visible in the top right corner). You can control the paddles
left and right to the exit holes using the mousebuttons (or with arrows or WSAD keys).

It is very simple to "mod" this game using own files.
To do this just replace the files inside the data folder (there is also a info textfile
to discribe wich file is for what or what files can be exist to be automaticly be used).

The Game is just written using notepad++ as long with some tips by AI (o1-model).

Graphics are created using Stable Diffusion Forge WebUI as long with the layer diffusion
extension.

Songs / Music was written by me already in in the years 1990-1993 using protracker on the
Amiga Computer (later released to AmiNet https://aminet.net/search?query=hardraver).

Have fun :-)
